# monty-hall

The Monty Hall problem is loosely based on the television game show 'Let's Make a Deal'.

## Rules

You have to pick one of three doors. Behind **<ins>two</ins>** of them, there are goats,
which aren' the biggest treasure (unless you want to keep your backyard grass short).
**<ins>One</ins>** of them hides the real prize, let's say the Ford Focus RS.

After your initial pick, the host opens one door, revealing one of the goats
(don't confuse with GOAT like Jakub Wawrzyniak). After that, you can
change your pick. 
The paradox is, counterintuitively, that you should.

## How it works

Through a large number of generated games, it shows which strategy among those indicated is the most effective:
- Random decision change
- Staying with your choice
- Changing every time
